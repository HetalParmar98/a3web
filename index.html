        <p id = "UrbanPlanning"> Urban planning, also known as town planning, city planning, regional planning, 
            or rural planning in specific contexts, is a technical and political process that 
            is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, 
            including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, 
            such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks and their accessibility. 
            Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of 
            human settlements. The primary concern was the public welfare, which included considerations of efficiency, 
            sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities.</p>

        <p id = "RemoteSensing"> Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, 
            in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. 
            Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines. 
            It also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.</p>

        <p id = "Surveying"> Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, art, and science of determining the terrestrial two-dimensional or three-dimensional 
            positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. 
            These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, 
            locations, such as the designed positions of structural components for construction or the surface location of subsurface features, 
            or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.</p>
